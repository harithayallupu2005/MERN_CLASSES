1.**BASICS OF HTML:**

HTML which stands for "HyperText Markup Language".It is the standard language used to create webpages.
It structures content using elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and buttons,
which are defined by tags enclosed in angle brackets (e.g., <p> for a paragraph).


2.**HTML ELEMENTS:**

HTML elements are the building blocks of web pages and consist of:

1.TAGS: Elements are defined by tags enclosed in angle brackets, such as <p> for paragraphs or
        <a> for links.
2.ATTRIBUTES: Tags can include attributes that provide additional information, like href in
              <a href="https://example.com">.
3.CONTENT: The content is placed between the opening and closing tags, such as the text inside
           a <p> tag.
4.CLOSING TAGS: Most elements have closing tags (e.g., </p>), except for self-closing tags like <img>.


3.**HTML TAGS**

HTML tags are used to define and structure content on a webpage.

A.HEADINGS:
<h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>: Define headings of different levels, with <h1> being the 
largest and <h6> the smallest.

B.PARAGRAPH:
<p>: Defines a paragraph of text.

C.LINKS:
<a href="URL">: Creates a hyperlink to another webpage or resource.

D.IMAGES:
<img src="URL" alt="description">: Embeds an image with a source URL and alternative text.

E.LISTS:
<ul>: Defines an unordered list.
<ol>: Defines an ordered list.
<li>: Defines a list item within <ul> or <ol>.

F.BUTTONS:
<button>: Creates a clickable button.

G.DIVISION:
<div>: Groups content and applies styles or layout.

H.Span:
<span>: Inline container for styling or grouping small pieces of content.


4.**HTML ATTRIBUTES:**

HTML attributes provide additional information about an element and are included within the
opening tag.

href: Specifies the URL of a link.
Example: <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>

src: Specifies the source URL for an image or other media.
Example: <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of image">

alt: Provides alternative text for images, useful for accessibility.
Example: <img src="logo.png" alt="Company Logo">

class: Assigns one or more class names to an element, used for styling with CSS.
Example: <div class="container">Content here</div>

id: Provides a unique identifier for an element, often used for styling or scripting.
Example: <p id="intro">Welcome to the website</p>

style: Applies inline CSS styles directly to an element.
Example: <p style="color: red;">This text is red.</p>

target: Specifies how to open a link, such as in a new tab (_blank) or the same frame (_self).
Example: <a href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank">Open in a new tab</a>

Attributes are written as name-value pairs, with the value enclosed in quotes.
